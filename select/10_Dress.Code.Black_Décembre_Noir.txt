Silent days
Days of emptiness
I am alone
For too long

I am the product of the acid rain
Designed under the clouds of society
A burnt out candle among so many lights
The poisoned apple that no one needs

Too dark for this flickering world
Dresscode black

Wasted years
Years of nothingness
The past seems to be meaningless
Therefore I am too dark for this flickering world
Too dark to unfurl my light

Weeping cold eyes
Eyes that mourn behind a mask
Mask of frustration and darkness
No one shall see the flowing tears
Yes, it's true - I'm not able to be like you

I am the product of the acid rain
Designed under the clouds of society
A burnt out candle among so many lights
The poisoned apple that no one needs

Too dark for this flickering world
Dresscode black

Silent days
Days of emptiness
Yes, it's true
I'm not able to be like you
